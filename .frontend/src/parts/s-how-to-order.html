        <h2 id="2">Where do we deliver?</h2>
        <p>BloomBar offers fresh flower delivery all over the South Australian metropolitan area -- from the CBD all the way to Seaford.

        <h2 id="3">How do I care for fresh flowers?</h2>
        <p>If you just received a flower bouquet from someone special or decided to treat yourself, knowing how to care for fresh flowers is important to get the most out of your BloomBar bouquets! </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cut the end of the stems off with sharp scissors. </li>
          <li>Place the flowers in a vase, filled with ¾ of fresh water.</li>
          <li>Change the water and re-cut the stems every few days.</li>
          <li>If you purchase flowers in a vase, they will already have water. All you need to do is follow the above steps the day after you receive the flowers.</li>
          <li>If you purchase flowers in floral form, you need to refill the water daily so the flowers won’t dry out. </li>
        </ul>
