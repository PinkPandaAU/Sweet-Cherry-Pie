        <p>Since Studio Botanic’s explosive launch in 2013, we have cultivated a tremendously talented team of florists. With the seasonality of the events industry, we wanted to keep our close knit family together and their fingertips to the florals. From this desire BloomBar was born. </p>
        <p>Opening on August 5th 2016 we launched the baby sister brand in Westfield Marion as a Pop-Up concept for Westfield Marion's New Food Hall Launch. The store was so well received, we extended the pop-up for a full year… to now a permanent feature and a destination flower shop for many in Adelaide!</p>
