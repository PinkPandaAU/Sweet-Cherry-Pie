Best friends Honey Jane Wyatt and Maria Jose Hayaux du Tilly paint a candid picture of relationships and dating in their 20s, from sharing funny stories, to hard life lessons learnt (and learning). Typical episodes go from heavy discussions about whether they’re difficult to love to cringing at sex stores from their listeners and each other. Listen in to hear two girls talking about all the details of their sex and love lives, and to maybe learn something along the way.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/au\/podcast\/sextras\/id1520259535\">Listen Here<\/a><\/p>",
