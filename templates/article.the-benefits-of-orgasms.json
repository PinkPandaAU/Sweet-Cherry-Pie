            "answer-new": "<p>If you’ve ever felt embarrassed about indulging in a little spot of solo sexy time, the message from sexperts and neurologists is a categorical and deafening “DON’T!” The benefits of orgasms are far more varied and notable that you might realise, so whether you are currently in a relationship or single, setting some time aside for your own sexual self-care can be equally as important for your health and wellbeing as regular exercise and watching what you eat!<\/p><p>Adding a new sex toy to your me-time schedule is a great way to explore your erogenous zones and discover what you like, and exactly how you like it! And they can be a great way to get you from A-to-Ohhhhh fast!  Sweet Cherry Pie want women to step into their sexual power and stop thinking of masturbation as a dirty little secret.<\/p><p><em>Masturbation is a natural human act (yes, even for women) with numerous health benefits, and is one of the most satisfying ways to practice self-care and relax. It can even improve partnered sex. After all, if you get to know your sexual body, and learn what really makes you tick, it’s a lot easier to teach your partner what you like. When you think about it, how well can we really know our own body if we leave all of the exploration of it up to someone else? It’s like giving someone directions to the moon…we know the general direction to head in, but we’ve never been there ourselves!<\/em><\/p><p>Well, you certainly can’t argue with that!<\/p>",
