Masturbation is a natural human act, and one of the most satisfying ways to practice self-care and relax and it can even improve partnered sex. After all, if you get to know your sexual body, and learn what really makes you tick, it’s a lot easier to teach your partner to do the same. When you think about it, how well can we really know our own body if we leave all of the exploration of it up to someone else? It’s like giving someone directions to the moon…we know the general direction to head in, but we’ve never been there ourselves!<\/p>",
